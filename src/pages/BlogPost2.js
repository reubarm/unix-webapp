<br/><h3>How Metaverse Will Affect Crypto</h3>
<p>The metaverse is the most exciting technological development of the next decade. It promises to give users experiences that are potentially as good as or better than any they could have in the real world. A combination of new technologies, including AR, blockchain, crypto and AI, is making it possible to create levels of immersion that are comparable to conventional reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you might expect, crypto will play a central role in the future metaverse ecosystem. Users will require it to secure and protect information relating to currency, gaming and NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we discuss in detail how the metaverse will affect crypto and how people use it. We will also talk about the value of exchanges, such as ours, in creating an ecosystem that will support crypto games.</p>
<br/><h3>The Metaverse Will Help Make Crypto Currency More Meaningful</h3>
<p>The traditional investment community views crypto as a speculative asset &ndash; something that doesn&rsquo;t have intrinsic value but market participants are bidding up in price anyway. But the metaverse could give it real clout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already, Android crypto games 2022 and crypto games for IoS are developing their own cryptocurrencies &ndash; as listed on our platform &ndash; and more join them every day. The idea is to create a bridge between the value players create in-game and real world financial rewards. Developers want to make it so that players can trade coins they earn while playing for other currencies on exchanges. In so doing, the metaverse and free crypto games could expand on existing uses of crypto dramatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the metaverse is impacting crypto currency beyond that. It is also creating demand for instant online transactions. Current banking clearing houses are clunky and don&rsquo;t provide the type of agility that virtual environments entail. Users want to pay and get paid immediately, but with legacy technology, there are delays, particularly when transacting internationally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metaverse cryptocurrency wallets change all this. Not only do they help users interact with each other more easily &ndash; as though they were trading in person &ndash; but they also give them confidence that their transactions will go through, thanks to the underlying blockchain. Ultimately, crypto will make payment security in metaverse environments, such as casino crypto games and free to play crypto games, a triviality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, metaverse-based crypto payments are already here for crypto games 2020. Games, such as Axie Infinity, already have their own currencies. And, even beyond that, the metaverse is beginning to build out cryptocurrency acceptance protocols as a whole. While adoption rates remain relatively low, options to use crypto (and benefit from it), will continue to expand.&nbsp;</p>
<br/><h3>The Metaverse Will Make Gaming More Rewarding For Players</h3>
<p>Great gaming communities are surprisingly rare. Certain games, such as World of Warcraft, CounterStrike, and Dota 2 did a good job of bringing people together in the past, but they were a rarity. Most games sparkle for a while and then quickly die out. Gamers would enjoy titles for a few weeks (or maybe just days), and then move onto the next thing. Only a small core of committed fans would remain, stymying incentives to update or upgrade the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For developers, this was a problem. The lack of continuing interest in games disincentivized updating them, meaning that, in many cases, gamers have to put up with unfinished products indefinitely (or modify them themselves). It also means that they don&rsquo;t get the type of high quality social-interactive experiences that they&rsquo;re looking for because the community is so small. Many multiplayer options simply don&rsquo;t work due to small player sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legit crypto games like Axie Infinity, though, are trying to change this sorry state of affairs. Instead of just allowing the developer to gobble up all the profits, the idea is to reward players for the valuable community roles that they play, encouraging them to stick with the game for longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way metaverse games work is surprising. Players complete tasks in-game and then earn cryptocurrency (usually one created by the game itself). Because it is blockchain-based (unlike conventional in-game tokens), they can trade their coins for other assets in the real-world. This way, some players are able to generate hundreds of dollars per day, encouraging them to continue engaging with the platforms. Over time, the hope is that this approach will encourage the development of persistent gaming communities, like those discussed in the above examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, crypto games for PC are going to change how people interact with the metaverse. Gaming could become a paid vocation for many talented players, allowing them to benefit directly from their contribution to games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The metaverse is also going to lead to the development of many new cryptocurrencies. For instance, players who have not completed in-game tasks to earn in-game coins could trade other cryptos, such as bitcoin, for those assets. They could then use those coins to purchase the things they want in-game.</p>
<p>Particularly rare items could sell for hundreds of dollars worth of in-game currency. Hence, games could have more of a lottery feel to them. When algorithms roll for items, it might feel similar to playing slots.&nbsp;</p>
<br/><h3>The Metaverse Will Make NFTs Mainstream</h3>
<p>Thanks to Beeple &ndash; a music artist who sold an NFT for over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$69 million</a> in 2021 &ndash; non-fungible tokens are already on many people&rsquo;s radar. But according to commentators, the emergence of the metaverse will send their popularity skyward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already seeing this happen. For instance, Coca-Cola recently launched a line of branded virtual clothing that users operating in the digital universe can wear on their avatars. The fact that they <em>are</em> NFT-based means that they are exclusive in the digital space. Only a few players will be able to wear them.</p>
<p>Gucci is doing something similar through iPhone crypto games, such as Roblox. The Italian fashion brand is selling its digital limited edition &ldquo;Gucci Collection&rdquo; to player avatars &ndash; a similar business model to Coca-Cola.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this development is that the company background doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter. Both drinks manufacturers and fashion brands are both able to use NFTs to generate revenues in the real-world and promote their brands online. How the ecosystem will develop when there are thousands of brands and millions of users interacting in the metaverse remains to be seen. However, so long as brands can generate scarcity with NFTs, the value of their tokens will directly relate to the power of their brands in the real world. In other words, player demand will influence token selling prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFTs also benefit from the fact that blockchain essentially eliminates the risk of counterfeiting. Thus, in some way, metaverse representations of brands could be far more reliable than their real-world counterparts. Right now, brands have major fraud concerns (particularly when shipping internationally). But so long as blockchain security holds up (which it likely will), the online space could become considerably more appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2017 onwards, users could view NFTs across platforms. Different wallet providers and virtual worlds adopted open blockchain standards, providing a clear, trusted API for reading and writing data. This interoperability improved the tradability of NFTs and expanded the ecosystem in which they apply. Users can purchase them with traditional crypto, stable coins, and fiat money, leading to increases in accessibility and price. Hence, the metaverse is already creating an environment in which NFTs can thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to the opinions of many industry leaders, they are not a passing fad. Instead, they are the equivalent of real-world status symbols, such as cars, houses and jewelry.&nbsp;</p>
<br/><h3>How UniX Gaming Exchanges Work</h3>
<p>UniX is working to create a decentralized governance token that will allow investors to take advantage of the play-to-earn gaming revolution. The idea is to reward players for their online activity and skills and then enable them to trade the tokens they earn for money, goods, services or anything else they want to purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UniX Token &ndash; ticker $UNIX &ndash; is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, we are raising funds to expand our NFT pool and accumulate land plots in play-to-earn games, such as Axie Infinity. We&rsquo;re also looking to begin the development of our own games and invest in others based on this model. In building out this approach, we intend to create a virtual economy in the metaverse, using DAO tokens, NFTs and crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particularly, UniX gaming will introduce the fun of the play-to-earn model in developing countries where average monthly incomes are as low as $100 to $250 per month. Online gaming communities could potentially provide people with a route of poverty, allowing them to earn incomes comparable to Western wages.&nbsp;</p>
<br/><h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>The metaverse is going to affect Android crypto games, Binance crypto games and many others by creating brand new ecosystems that reward players for their time and skill. It is also going to change the role of crypto, transforming it from something that is purely about real-world transactions into a vehicle for instant online payments as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFTs will likely become a favorite blockchain-based technology of brands, allowing them to create scarcity in online environments. In fact, wholesale digitization could help them deal with intractable real-world problems, such as fraud.&nbsp;</p>
